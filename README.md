# Arduino-Projects

These files are for Arduino projects. Files include a Word doc with a project overview, breadboard wiring diagram and 
an example sketch, a .jpg file showing the breadboard wiring and an .ino file containing the sketch itself.
These files are free to use and modify without restrictions. 
If you use them as part of a teaching project, just cite me as a contributing author.
