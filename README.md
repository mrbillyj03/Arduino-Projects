# Arduino-Projects

These files are for Arduino projects. Files include a .jpg file showing the breadboard wiring, 
an .ino file containing the sketch itself and a Word .docx with a project overview, breadboard wiring diagram and 
an example sketch.
These files are free to use and modify without restrictions. 
If you use them as part of a teaching project, just cite me as a contributing author.
