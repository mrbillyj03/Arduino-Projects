# Arduino-Projects

These files are for Arduino project files. Files include a Word doc with a project overview, breadboard wiring diagram and 
an example sketch, and the shetch itself. These files are free to use and modify without restrictions. If you use them as 
part of a teaching project, just cite me as a contributing author.
